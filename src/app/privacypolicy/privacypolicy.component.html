<p>We take website and credit card security extremely seriously and always endeavour to provide a secure, safe platform from which to conduct online transactions. We use the industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Protocol, which encrypts information as it is transmitted over the internet.

<p>To ensure you are accessing a secure server, look for the unbroken key or closed lock symbol located either at the bottom left or top right of your browser window. If it appears, then SSL is active. You can double-check by looking at the URL. If SSL is active, then the first characters of the URL will read &lsquo;https&rsquo; rather than just &lsquo;http.&rsquo; it is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and your computer.</p>
